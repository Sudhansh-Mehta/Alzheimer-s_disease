ML/ DL techniques for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) early diagnosis and mapping progression
Millions of people across the world suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain) severely affecting their quality of life. The problem of waiting queues for getting medical imaging scans (structural brain MRI scans) done is only exacerbated by even lesser ratio of qualified technicians and Neuroradiologists who generate the technical report. Towards that end the current work tries to alleviate the problem of patients by developing a toolkit where in only the scans need be fed in to the models, which provide a classification of the different stages of cognitive health and the prognostic prediction/risk of patient declining into full-blown AD.
